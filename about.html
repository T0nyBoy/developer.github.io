                    I am Antony, civil engineer from Greece, and for the last 3 years I have been residing in the UK. 
                    Computers were always my passion so I decided to go a little bit further and try learn web development on my own.
               <br><br>
                    Everything started when I got a Java how-to book and tryed to learn a bit of coding.
                    Basically no. Everything started when my father got our first computer back in the 80s!!
                    Olivetti PCS 286 it was! Amazing memories. Hours spent on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-y8dvsLYJM">Accolade's Grand Prix</a> 
                    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv20j8ChtRY">Price of Persia</a>. Monochrome screen, loosey mouse, 8bit sound, MS-DOS and then Windows 3.1!
                    <br><br>
                    Fast forward, the first real programming I did was on my Master's degree for 
                    my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ly33hcbwme39rsq/Raftopoulos_Antonios_Masters_Thesis.pdf?dl=0">desertation</a>.
                    I used Mathematica to produce some complex data for aerial chemistry and to produce maps of aerosol distribution. After this I tried my luck with
                    Matlab but gave up pretty soon as I did not have anything to apply it on.
                    Then R came. I took a coursera course which lasted about 1 month and I got a bit deeper into programming. 
                    I also used to write (and still do but not that frequently) AutoLISP and VBA to make my life easier when I use AutoCAD and MS-Excel.
                    <br><br>
                    On October 2019 I took a Python course on Udemy and the main programming journey started.
                    After completing it I didn't know what to do and how to apply Python so I wondered around the development labyrinths and I took another 
                    course on Udemy, MySQL this time. By the time I started falling in love with Udemy and its courses.
                    At the end, I had a small taste of web development and how it can be used with SQL databases. 
                    So, next step was the harderst, longest and most enjoyable! I got my self into <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/">Colt Steele's</a> 
                    <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp</a>. 
                    It took me 2 months to finish it, thanks to lockdown, but admittedly this course generally should have taken 4+ months.
                    After this I had a solid base to start learning and creating even more things. More educetional courses followed to get deeper 
                    into Javascript and web development and here we are.
                    More than a year after I took this Python course, I am creating my own portfolio page, setting up some trial e-commerce websites, creating online tools, 
                    uploading code on github and getting my hands dirty with
                    designing and developing pages and apps.
                    <br><br>
                    I love engineering & programming!
                </p>

                    Cheers,<br>
