                        <br>
                        After reaching a point that I practiced with front end and vanilla
                        <b>Javascript </b>I thought it was a good idea to create my own
                        page before I move on with a framework (React).<br>
                        This page is purely written in <b>HTML </b><b>Sass </b>and <b>vanilla
                  
                        </b><b>Javascript </b>in <i>VS Code</i>.<br>
                        <br>
                        <img
                          src="/assets/photos/htmllogo.png"
                          alt="" height="128" width="328"><br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <font size="+2"><i>How it is constructed:</i></font><br>
                        There are some main structural elements to that make these pages
                        work.<br>
                        <br>
                        <img
                          src="/assets/photos/JavaScript-logo.png"
                          alt="" height="156" width="156"><br>
                        First of all, there is a main .js file that is used to inject the
                        &lt;head&gt;, the menu bar, the footer and the contact form on the
                        pages. Every page has a separate html file with empty &lt;nav&gt;,
                        &lt;head&gt;, &lt;footer&gt; etc. that gets them injected with
                        innerHTML to achieve consistency. Secondly, all the pages have
                        some js especially written for each one. In example blog has the
                        blog.js so it can get the elements from the database. This file
                        also handles pagination, search box and results etc. (pagination
                        is also written by me and I can admit was not easy). For all the
                        styling I used Sass that makes life easier regarding the colours,
                        functions, specificity and many other stuff and it was compiled to
                        normal CSS with <i><a
                  href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass">Live
                  
                            Sass Compiler</a></i>. The format is based on flex and I make
                        use of some new shiny toys like neumorphism, rotations, hoverings
                        etc that give this newish feeling of a page. <br>

                        <br>
                        <font size="+2"><i>As for database<br>
                            <br>

                          src="/assets/photos/google-sheets.png"
                          alt="" height="138" width="149">&nbsp;<br>
                        I use Google Sheets. Yes, Google Sheets!<br>
                        It is amazing how flexible they can be. Generally I do not like
                        Google Sheets to work with, but in terms of scripting I think
                        Microsoft has left behind by miles by using VBA only as Excel's
                        main language (JS can be used but needs some tricks and the
                        documentation is far from clear). On the other hand, Google uses
                        Javascript-ish language for its scripts and in combination with
                        other Google Services, endpoints can be created, GET and POST
                        requests can be sent and then the magic happens! <br>
                        I use Google Sheets API to create a JSON endpoint for the blog
                        data (link will follow soon). <br>
                        <br>
                        <img src="/assets/photos/JSON.png" alt="" height="142" width="142"><br>
                        <br>
                        I also use the API to create the contact list and interact with
                        the user. Specifically, the contact list uses a Google Sheet to
                        store the form data that user sends and also to send me an email
                        with these data. Free google users have up to 100 mails per day
                        and for a small website I consider this more than enough. If there
                        is a need for a bigger site/company and more traffic then other
                        solutions are more suitable but costly (not much).<br>
                        <br>
                        Other small github projects I created and worth mentioning are:<br>

                            Weather</a> which I like the styling I made. <br>
                          This one uses a free weather API to fetch weather data.<br>
