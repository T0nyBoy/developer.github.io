If you click the navbar button while you are at the top of the page the menu pushes the rest of the page below it. Scrolling down while the menu is open will then push the page behind it.

In the footer, the text overflows out of the element. I'm not sure if the lighter-blue line on top is a just a border but I would just remove it

What I do: I feel like the logos of each section take too much space within the element they're in. 
It looks like half? 
Might be a bit excessive and it makes the text harder to read. 
Potential clients will be more interested in the text than the logo, so I would adjust that

X at the top of contact form should be a little more to the right

on the blog page it takes a few clicks for me to open the entry (although my phone is pretty crappy so it might be just on my end).

the social media icons and text on the bottom of the home page are a little off.
